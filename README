pcienema
--------
Locates and identifies all PCI devices on a system.

To run, you will probably need superuser (e.g. root) permissions, if you get an
error, try rocking some 'sudo':  `sudo pcienema'


Why?
----
Because I wanted to.


Doesn't lspci (aka pciutils) do the same thing?
-----------------------------------------------
Yep, and lspci does a whole lot more.  pcienema performs a brute-force scan and
queries all potential PCI devices for their configuration information (just the
vendor/device register).  This tool does not rely on the /proc or /sys (sysfs)
filesystems for locating devices.  This tool uses "Configuration Method #1" to
scan the PCI configuration space.
